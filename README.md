## Reflections on PID
The behaviour is what I was expecting, the car was able, after some manual trial and error tuning, to drive through the track without going outside the lane. Anyway the followed trajectory is a bit unstable especially on turns.
To improve performance a more automated parameter tuning, like the Twiddle presented in the lessons, would surely help even if probably will not complety stabilize the trajectory.
